## Idea
Imagine a super-smart camera system that sees everything at your worksite. Argus uses these video brains to help oil, gas, construction, and factory crews work smarter, safer, and more securely. By simply watching, Argus can spot ways to boost efficiency, predict accidents before they happen, and even prevent theft â€“ all :without fancy extras. It's like having a guardian angel with a keen eye, keeping your workplace running smoothly.
## Features
Argus: Your Smart Desktop Companion: Monitor activity in common areas with our easy-to-use desktop application. Argus provides valuable insights to optimize workflows and ensure everything runs smoothly.

SuperArgus: Stay Connected, Stay Informed: Manage your entire operation remotely with our feature-rich Android app, SuperArgus. Get real-time updates, leverage the built-in smart assistant for added convenience, and enjoy peace of mind knowing your workplace is always under watchful eyes.

Labelify: Empowering Future Advancements: As ProVision evolves, Labelify plays a crucial role. This tool helps us gather vast amounts of data, allowing us to develop even more functionalities and refine existing features at an accelerated pace. Ultimately, Labelify paves the way for a more powerful and intelligent ProVision in the future.

# Overview

This prototype tool is designed to speed up the process of labeling images for object detection

tasks using a semi-supervised approach. It leverages a pre-trained YOLO


model to generate initial object detections, allowing users to confirm or correct the 

predictions for more efficient labeling.

# Key Features

## Semi-Supervised Labeling: Utilizes a YOLO model to generate initial object detections using mannual labeling, reducing large manual labeling effort.
## User-Friendly Interface: Provides a visual interface for reviewing model predictions and providing feedback.
## Label Storage: Stores correct labels in text files for use in model training.
## Feedback Collection: Captures images with incorrect predictions for later analysis or model improvement.
